lab discription
This lab focuses on adding interactivity to a multi-page website using JavaScript. You'll be building upon a previous website structure, or starting fresh, to implement features like a theme toggle, form validation with user feedback, fetching data from an external API to display dynamic content, and creating an interactive FAQ section. By the end of this lab, you should have a solid understanding of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user events, validate form input, and integrate external APIs to create a more engaging and dynamic user experience.

to view the website, simply open the index.html or contact.html files in your web browser. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Open with' followed by your preferred browser 1  (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). Alternatively, you can drag and drop the HTML files directly into your browser window.

During this lab, I faced a few challenges, particularly with separating the JavaScript code for the contact.html form from the index.html functionality. Initially, all JavaScript was in one file, causing errors due to the contact.html form elements not being present on the index.html page. Separating the scripts into script.js for index.html and contactScript.js for contact.html resolved this issue. I also learned the importance of carefully checking element IDs and class names to ensure they match between the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, handling asynchronous operations with the Fetch API required a good understanding of async/await and error handling with try...catch blocks.
